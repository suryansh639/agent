## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust 1.94.1 or later** - Install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)
- **Git** - For version control
- **Cargo** - Comes with Rust
- **OpenSSL development libraries** (Linux only):
  - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install pkg-config libssl-dev`
  - Fedora: `sudo dnf install openssl-devel`
  - Arch: `sudo pacman -S openssl`

   cd agent
   ```
3. **Add upstream remote:**
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/stakpak/agent.git
   ```

### Build the Project

```bash
# Build in debug mode (faster compilation)
cargo build

# Build in release mode (optimized)
cargo build --release

# Build a specific crate
cargo build -p stakpak-cli
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test --workspace

```

### Run the CLI Locally

```bash
# Run in development mode
cargo run

# Run with specific flags
cargo run -- --help
cargo run -- --verbose

# Run a specific command
cargo run -- mcp --tool-mode local
```

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

Always create a new branch for your work:

```bash
# Sync with upstream
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature

# Or for a bug fix
git checkout -b fix/issue-123-description
```

**Branch Naming Conventions:**
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Adding or updating tests
- `perf/` - Performance improvements

### 2. Make Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow the [Code Guidelines](#code-guidelines)
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Keep commits focused and atomic

### 3. Test Your Changes

Before submitting, ensure:

```bash
# Code compiles without errors
cargo check --all-targets

# All tests pass
cargo test --workspace

# Code is properly formatted
cargo fmt --check

# No clippy warnings
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings

# Build succeeds in release mode
cargo build --release
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add GitHub integration tools

- Implement github_read_issues tool
- Add GitHub API client wrapper
- Include error handling and tests

Closes #123"
```

**Commit Message Format:**
```
<type>: <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
# Push your branch
git push origin feature/my-new-feature
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub.

## 📝 Code Guidelines

### Rust Style

We follow standard Rust conventions and use `rustfmt` and `clippy`:

```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt

# Run clippy
cargo clippy --all-targets
```

### Key Principles

1. **No Unwrap/Expect**
   - We deny `unwrap()` and `expect()` via clippy
   - Use proper error handling with `Result` and `?` operator
   - Use `match` or `if let` for `Option` types

   ```rust
   // ❌ Bad
   let value = some_option.unwrap();
   
   // ✅ Good
   let value = match some_option {
       Some(v) => v,
       None => return Err("Value not found".into()),
   };
   ```

2. **Error Handling**
   - Use `anyhow::Result` for application errors
   - Use `thiserror` for library errors
   - Provide meaningful error messages

   ```rust
   use anyhow::{Result, Context};
   
   fn read_config() -> Result<Config> {
       let contents = std::fs::read_to_string("config.toml")
           .context("Failed to read config file")?;
       // ...
       Ok(config)
   }
   ```

3. **Async Code**
   - Use `tokio` for async runtime
   - Prefer `async/await` over manual futures
   - Be mindful of blocking operations in async contexts

4. **Code Organization**
   - Keep functions small and focused
   - Use meaningful variable and function names
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Organize related functionality into modules

5. **Security**
   - Never log or print secrets
   - Use the secret redaction system for sensitive data
   - Validate all external input
   - Be cautious with file system operations

## 🧪 Testing

### Writing Tests

Add tests for all new functionality:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_feature_works() {
        let result = my_function();
        assert_eq!(result, expected_value);
    }

    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_async_feature() {
        let result = my_async_function().await;
        assert!(result.is_ok());
    }
}
```

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests** - Test individual functions/modules
2. **Integration Tests** - Test component interactions
3. **Platform Tests** - Test on Linux, macOS, Windows

### Running Specific Tests

```bash
# Run tests matching a pattern
cargo test test_name

# Run tests in a specific file
cargo test --test integration_test

# Run doc tests
cargo test --doc

# Run with verbose output
cargo test -- --test-threads=1 --nocapture
```
